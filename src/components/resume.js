                    Hello, my name is David Rodriguez I am a twenty-one year old Hispanic Male. I was born in San Jose, CA, then my family moved to the central Valley, Visalia, CA, when I was eight years old. Never really thought I would get into coding or cared to. After graduating high school I knew something had to change. Freshmen and Sophomore years of college were mostly me finding myself, really still not knowing what I wanted to do. Nonetheless, I went from a computer science major, to a criminology major, to a music major,I play the cello and the piano, and finally back to computer science. I would say I found true happiness in 2018. What made me find this was finally doing what I really wanted to be doing everyday which is going to class, the gym, coding projects that I have always wanted to make, and writing music while still making time to hang out with my friends and family. I found out computer science was for me sophomore year during my introduction to computer science class. What happened was I took it not knowing anything about coding so it was very challenging, but fun which made me motivated to keep trying to get better and better at coding while also understanding concepts. Never had I struggled in a class so much, to the point where I had to study like crazy to pass with a B, not even an A. Even with only a B I felt so accomplished knowing that I had passed my intro to computer science class. This feeling is similar to the one I get when my program has a bug that I can not seem to figure out for hours sometimes then I finally am able to fix it, then my program finally runs. I love that feeling. It is such drastic change in mind state when going from completely stressed because your code will not run and finally running it and knowing that all that hard work was for something.
